# edc_analyzer

Python scripts (Python Version 3.7) for controlling the EDC analyzer.

The first script ('edc_analyzer/imi_cadent3/') enables the serial communication to a Cadent-3 syringe pump (IMI Precision, Switzerland) equipped with a2.5-mL syringe and a rotary 12-way selection valve. The script allows to send commands and receive status reports via an RS-232 communication line.

The second script ('edc_analyzer/runge_mikron31/') enables the serial communication to a double-wavelength photometer (Mirkon31, Runge, Germany). The script allows to send commands and receive status reports via USB.

A manuscript describing the EDC analyzer was submitted to the journal Water Research (IWA).
