# Instrument Control for an EDC Analyzer

Python scripts (Python Version 3.7) for controlling the EDC analyzer.

The first script ('edc_analyzer/imi_cadent3/') enables the serial communication to a Cadent-3 syringe pump (IMI Precision, Switzerland) equipped with a 2.5-mL syringe and a 12-way rotary selection valve. The script allows to send commands and receive status reports via an RS-232 communication line.

The second script ('edc_analyzer/runge_mikron31/') enables the serial communication to a double-wavelength photometer (Mirkon31, Runge, Germany). The script allows to send commands and receive photometer data via USB and displays the results in a live-updated plot.

A manuscript of a research article describing the EDC analyzer was submitted to the journal Water Research (IWA).

More information on the publication will be published soon.
